# 🧾 KindScript: Symptom Summary Generator

**KindScript** is a calm, human-centered tool for creating clear, low-stress letters or summaries — especially when you're overwhelmed, anxious, or navigating complex health situations.

This first script helps you prepare for a medical appointment by generating a written summary of your symptoms, concerns, and goals — so you don’t have to explain everything out loud or on the spot.

## ✨ What It Does

- Lets you enter symptom and timeline information
- Outputs a printable, copyable summary in plain language
- Includes one-click **Copy to Clipboard** and **Print** buttons
- Uses gentle, readable styling to reduce overwhelm

---

## 📋 Example Use Case

You're about to meet with a doctor, and your brain is foggy from stress, pain, or decision fatigue.

Instead of trying to explain everything live, you fill this out in advance — and hand it over.

Done. Breathe.

## 🕊️ Project Philosophy

KindScript is for people who are:

- Burned out  
- Anxious  
- Sick of explaining things 10 times  
- Trying to stay organized through uncertainty

This isn’t about productivity.  
It’s about clarity when everything feels foggy.

> You don’t need a mantra.  
> You need a plan.
