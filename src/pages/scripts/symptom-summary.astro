    <h1>📝 Symptom Summary</h1>

    <p>A template to help explain what’s been going on before an appointment — so you don’t have to try to remember everything on the spot, or say everything out loud.</p>

    <h2>🔍 What this tool is</h2>
    <p>This page helps you write a clear summary of what’s been going on — symptoms, changes, questions, or needs. It’s useful for medical visits, refill requests, or hard conversations when your brain’s at capacity.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🔒 <strong>Private by design</strong><br />Everything you type stays on your device and never gets sent anywhere — no servers, no databases, no tracking. Your information is processed entirely in your browser.</li>
      <li>🩺 <strong>Not medical advice</strong><br />This is a writing tool to help you advocate for yourself or a loved one. It isn’t a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</li>
    </ul>
