**KindScript** is a set of simple, human‑centered tools for creating clear, low‑stress letters or summaries — especially when you're overwhelmed, anxious, or navigating complex health situations.

You fill in a few prompts, and the tool gives you a ready‑to‑share output that you can copy, print, or download — so you can focus on care, not paperwork.

## ✨ Current Tools

### 📝 Symptom Summary Generator
Helps you prepare for a medical appointment by summarizing your symptoms, concerns, and goals — so you don’t have to explain everything out loud or on the spot.

### 💊 Medication List Tool
Prepares a clear, printable list of your current medications and supplements — useful for appointments, hospital stays, or when someone else needs to know what you’re taking.

### ✉️ Refill Request Generator
Creates a clear, polite message requesting a medication refill — for yourself or someone else. Choose between a **friendly note** or a **bullet-style entry**, and include any helpful context.

### 📄 Insurance Appeal Letter Generator
Gently drafts a letter to appeal an insurance denial. Includes both a **professional** and a **gentler** tone option, so you can match the style to your needs.

## 📋 Example Use Case

You’re about to meet with a doctor, call your insurance company, or check in at urgent care — and your brain is foggy from stress, anxiety, pain, or decision fatigue.  

Instead of scrambling to remember the details, you fill out a KindScript tool in advance and hand it over, upload it to a patient portal, or keep it on your phone for quick reference.

Done. Breathe.

## 🕊️ Project Philosophy

KindScript is for people who are:

- Burned out  
- Anxious  
- In pain  
- Sick of explaining things 10 times  
- Trying to stay organized through uncertainty  

This isn’t about productivity.  
It’s about clarity when everything feels foggy.

> You don’t need a mantra.  
> You need a plan.
