  To whom it may concern,

  I’m sharing this brief summary ahead of our upcoming appointment, in case it helps streamline the conversation.

  I’ve been dealing with the following symptoms or concerns since {{startDate}}:

  {{mainSymptoms}}

  To try and address or understand what's going on, I've already tried:

  {{whatYouTried}}

  At this point, I’m hoping to:

  {{whatYouNeed}}

  {{#if extraInfo}}
  Other context:

  {{extraInfo}}
  {{/if}}

  Thank you for taking the time to review this in advance. It’s been a lot to manage, and I appreciate anything we can do to make the next steps clearer.
