    <h1>📝 Symptom Summary</h1>

    <p>A template to help explain what’s been going on before an appointment — so you don’t have to try to remember everything on the spot, or say everything out loud.</p>

    <h2>🔍 What this tool is</h2>
    <p>
      This tool helps you write down what’s been going on with your body or mind — symptoms, changes, concerns, or questions — so you don’t have to carry it all in your head during an appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s here for those moments when everything feels like too much. When you’re overwhelmed, forget what you wanted to say, or freeze up in front of your doctor. Or when you’re supporting someone else and want to make sure nothing important gets missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use this summary during a medical visit, to request a prescription refill, or to help someone understand what’s going on when words are hard to find.
    </p>
