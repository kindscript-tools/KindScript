    <h1>🧭 What to Do When You’re Overwhelmed</h1>
    <p>If you’re here, something’s probably gone sideways. Maybe your insurance denied coverage. Maybe you’re preparing for a scary appointment. Maybe you’re trying to help someone else and don’t know where to begin. This page is for you.</p>

    <p>You don’t need to know the right terms. You don’t need a perfect explanation. Start where you are. We’ll help from there.</p>

    <h2>📋 My insurance denied something — now what?</h2>
    <p>If you got a denial letter or explanation of benefits (EOB), it probably says something like “not medically necessary” or “not covered under your plan.” That doesn’t mean you’re out of options.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 <a href="/scripts/insurance-appeal">Use the Insurance Appeal tool</a> to write a letter asking your insurance to reconsider.</li>
      <li>💬 You can also call your doctor’s office — sometimes they’ll send extra documentation on your behalf.</li>
      <li>📎 Keep your denial letter — it helps explain what needs to be addressed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🩺 I have an appointment coming up and I’m panicking</h2>
    <p>Whether it’s a new doctor, a follow-up, or a scary test — it helps to write down what’s been going on before the visit.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 <a href="/scripts/symptom-summary">Use the Symptom Summary tool</a> to get your thoughts down in a calm, clear way.</li>
      <li>📌 Bring a printed or saved version to your visit — you can even hand it to your provider.</li>
      <li>🤝 If you’re supporting someone else, you can fill it out together or on their behalf.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💊 I need a medication refill (or I’m worried about one being denied)</h2>
    <p>If you're out of meds, or worried your insurance won’t cover a refill, here’s where to start:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📋 <a href="/scripts/medication-list">Use the Medication List tool</a> to track what you’re taking and what needs a refill.</li>
      <li>📝 <a href="/scripts/refill-request">Use the Refill Request tool</a> to write a clear, respectful message to your doctor or clinic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧾 I need help with work or school</h2>
    <p>If your symptoms are affecting your ability to work, attend school, or keep up with responsibilities, you can ask for temporary support or accommodations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📝 <a href="/scripts/work-accommodation">Use the Work Accommodation tool</a> to write a respectful, clear request for flexibility.</li>
      <li>💡 You don’t need a diagnosis — just explain how your health is affecting what you can do.</li>
      <li>🤝 You can give the note to a healthcare provider to review, sign, or adjust as needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>👥 I’m helping someone else</h2>
    <p>You don’t have to have all the answers. These tools can help you gather information, speak up on their behalf, and stay organized.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🤲 Use the tools as if you were the patient — just add context about your relationship (e.g. “I’m helping my father, who’s been dealing with...”)</li>
      <li>💡 It’s okay to say “I don’t know” in a form or letter — just explain what you *do* know.</li>
    </ul>
