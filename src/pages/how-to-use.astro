    <h1>🧭 How to Use KindScript</h1>
    <p>KindScript is here for the moments when you need to say something important about your health — but your brain is already full, your heart is pounding, or you’re just plain tired. These tools help you <strong>find the words</strong> so you can focus on what matters.</p>

    <p>Whether you’re a patient, a caregiver, or just someone trying to navigate an insurance maze, here’s how to get the most out of this site.</p>

    <hr class="tool-divider">

    <h2>1️⃣ Pick the right tool for the moment</h2>
    <p>Our tools are grouped by category — things like doctor visits, insurance, medications, and workplace support. If you’re not sure where to start, check the <a href="/what-to-do">What to Do</a> page for quick guidance.</p>
    <p>Each tool will tell you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ What it’s for</li>
      <li>✅ How it works</li>
      <li>✅ Any extra tips to make your message clear</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="tool-divider">

    <h2>2️⃣ Fill in the blanks — only what you’re comfortable sharing</h2>
    <p>Every form has a few short fields. Fill in as much as you want. You can leave things blank — the tool will still create something useful. Nothing is saved or sent anywhere.</p>

    <hr class="tool-divider">

    <h2>3️⃣ Get your output</h2>
    <p>Once you click “Generate,” your message, letter, or list will appear instantly. You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>📋 Copy it to your clipboard</li>
      <li>🖨️ Print it out</li>
      <li>💾 Download it as a text file</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It’s yours to edit, personalize, or send however you like — in a patient portal, email, or on paper.</p>

    <hr class="tool-divider">

    <h2>4️⃣ Use it your way</h2>
    <p>KindScript isn’t about one “right” way to talk to your doctor, insurer, or employer. You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✏️ Edit the wording to make it sound like you</li>
      <li>📎 Attach it to other documents</li>
      <li>📅 Keep it for future reference</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some people use KindScript tools once in a crisis. Others come back regularly to keep a health journal, prepare for appointments, or manage ongoing care.</p>

    <hr class="tool-divider">

    <h2>5️⃣ Need inspiration?</h2>
    <p>If you’re feeling stuck or unsure what to write, try browsing the <a href="/scripts/messages">Quick Messages</a> page. It’s full of ready-made, short notes you can adapt for all kinds of healthcare situations.</p>

    <hr class="tool-divider">

    <h2>💡 Remember</h2>
    <p>You don’t have to be perfect, formal, or “professional” to get the care you need. Clear and honest is enough. And you don’t have to do it all at once — even a small step forward is progress.</p>
