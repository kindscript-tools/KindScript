    <h2>💡 What is KindScript?</h2>
    <p>
      KindScript is a small set of tools to help patients and caregivers handle the most frustrating parts of healthcare — like keeping track of symptoms, medications, or refilling prescriptions — with a little more ease and clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      These scripts aren’t magic, but they are kind. They help you get your thoughts in order when it’s hard to advocate for yourself, remember details, or explain things under pressure.
    </p>

    <h2>🔒 Your Data Stays with You</h2>
    <p>
      Nothing you type here is ever sent to a server. Everything runs locally in your browser — no tracking, no storage, no analytics. You don’t need an account, and we don’t even know you were here.
    </p>

    <h2>⚠️ Not Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>
      These tools are for support, not diagnosis. Always consult a healthcare professional if you're unsure or unwell.
    </p>

    <h2>🤝 Built with Care</h2>
    <p>
      KindScript is an independent project made to help people feel a little more equipped and a little less overwhelmed. If it helped you — or if you have ideas — <a href="/suggest">we’d love to hear from you</a>.
