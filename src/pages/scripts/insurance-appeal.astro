Re: Appeal for Denial of Coverage – MRI of my lower spine

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to formally appeal the denial of coverage for MRI of my lower spine, which was denied on August 1, 2025. This request has been recommended as medically necessary for my treatment by my healthcare provider, Dr. Alex Nguyen.

The stated reason for denial was: "Not medically necessary." I have tried other treatments that did not help. This MRI is the next step recommended by my doctor to determine the cause of ongoing pain and guide appropriate treatment.

I respectfully request a full review of this decision, considering the medical necessity and the supporting documentation provided by my healthcare provider.

Thank you for your time and for reviewing this appeal.

Sincerely,
Jordan Reyes

Hi BlueCross BlueShield,

I'm reaching out because my recent request for coverage of an MRI of my lower spine was denied on August 1, 2025. I understand this might be a routine policy, but I wanted to share why this is important for my health.

I've been experiencing ongoing pain, and my doctor, Dr. Alex Nguyen, has recommended this MRI as the next step. I've tried other treatments, but they haven't helped. This MRI could help identify what's going on and guide the right treatment plan.

Thank you for taking the time to reconsider this request.

Sincerely,
Jordan Reyes
